      When comparing CSS class vs ID the diffrence is that CSS class applies
      a style tp multiple elements. ID , on other hand , applies a style to one unique elements. ID is
      special in that you  can use special URL to link directly to an element and it's by Javascript.

      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements om web page. Once an element
      has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied  to the element.
